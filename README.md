# E-commerce Data Analysis Project – SHEIN Dataset
# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce data from the SHEIN dataset available on Kaggle. The aim is to extract meaningful business insights using Python and popular data analysis libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# Dataset Source: Kaggle - SHEIN E-commerce Dataset

Total Files Combined: 21 CSV files

Final Dataset Size: 82,105 rows × 13 columns

# Objective
Identify top-selling product categories.

Analyze how product price impacts sales volume.

Study discount patterns across categories.

Determine the ideal price range for products.

# Dataset Features
Column Name	Description
price	Product price in currency
discount	Discount offered (percentage)
goods-title-link	Product name
category	Product category
selling_proposition	Raw sales indicator (e.g., '1.5k sold')
selling_count	Cleaned numeric sales count

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Merged all 21 category CSV files into a single dataset.

Extracted numeric values from selling_proposition into selling_count.

Removed outliers in price and sales for visualization clarity.

Removed null values in critical columns like price and product title.

Dropped unnecessary columns not useful for analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Total Sales by Category
Grouped data by category and visualized with bar chart.

Identified high-performing categories like womens_clothing and appliances.

2. Price vs Selling Count
Created scatter plot to check relation between price and sales.

Found that products priced below ₹500 have significantly higher sales.

3. Average Discount by Category
Compared average discount % offered in each category.

4. Price Distribution
Used histogram and boxplot to understand pricing trends.

# Tools and Technologies
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn


# Outcome and Learnings
Built a clean and structured data analysis workflow from scratch.

Developed strong understanding of price-performance dynamics.

Gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, merging, visualization, and interpretation.

Improved storytelling through charts and data-backed insights.
